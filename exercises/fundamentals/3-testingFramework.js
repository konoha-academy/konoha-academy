// writing a testing framework
/*
Let's improve our error messages a bit, create a function
called `test` which can be given a title and a callback.
Then add a try/catch so you can log the title with
a note of success or error.
Then wrap each of your tests in a `test` function.
This also means that we can run all the tests even
if one of them fails!
Example of test function
test(title, () => {
  // arrange
  // act
  // assert
}
